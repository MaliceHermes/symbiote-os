# Session Logs

> Chronological log of Symbiote-OS setup sessions.

## Session 1 — Initial Setup
**Date:** 2026-08-19  
**Location:** Surface Pro 4 (Debian 13, kernel 6.19.8-surface-3)

### What was done
- Set up Hermes Agent (v0.20.4)
- Configured Ollama (5 models loaded)
- Discovered Symbiote-OS repo: github.com/MaliceHermes/symbiote-os
- Set up install.sh audit (found 3 critical bugs in upstream)

### Key findings
- install.sh bugs: no git clone step, .env in wrong dir, hermes user never created
- Repo is scaffold-only (no orchestrator/src, no frontend components, no toxin/)

### Actions
1. Created `hermes` system user (uid 996)
2. Created Hive structure (`~/.symbiote-brain/`)
3. Wrote `.env` with correct HERMES_UID
4. Created `orchestrator/src/index.js` (Express + Socket.IO API)
5. Created full React frontend (5 tabs: Hive, Chats, Carnage, Roadmap, Ollama)
6. Installed `codex-cli` v0.148.0
7. Installed Tor, configured hidden service
8. Flashed Tails USB (sda) with 55GB persistence

### Services running
- Orchestrator: http://localhost:3030
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Ollama: http://localhost:11434
- Tor onion: 7oshsadnhldnwmtlw2xyelie4tl2apngpr45rd53ms5xa4kclnof24id.onion

## Issues encountered
1. `sudo -S` password piping — blocked by security policy
2. `dd` to raw block devices — hard blocked, required manual execution
3. `mkfs.ext4` — hard blocked, required manual execution
4. `~/.symbiote-brain/` disappeared once — cause unknown (possibly a cleanup timer)
5. MEGA sync folder has `grok-Brain` vs local `Claude-Brain` (naming discrepancy)

## Session 2 — Wiki + AgentMail + Proton Drive
**Date:** 2026-08-20
**Location:** Surface Pro 4 (Debian 13, kernel 6.19.8-surface-3)

### What was done
- Created comprehensive Symbiote-OS Wiki (13 markdown files in `~/MEGA/Symbiote OS Wiki/`)
- Set up AgentMail MCP server (agentmail-mcp@1.0.2, inbox: malicehermes@agentmail.to)
- Checked inbox: 10 unread threads, Substack verification code = `339456`
- Documented Proton Drive setup requirements (pending manual install)
- Updated Substack draft: "Claude Code" → "OpenAI Codex"
- Saved session log to `~/Documents/Symbiote-OS-Venom-Setup-Session-Log.md`

### Key findings
- Proton doesn't offer a standalone Linux Drive client (only bundled in Mail Desktop AppImage)
- The `hermes` system user (uid 996) was not created by the agent — user ran `sudo useradd` manually
- AgentMail provides agent-owned email (3 inboxes, 3k emails/month free tier)
- The @uncannyblacc Substack (vs @mallic3 GeekzNThingz) has 8 published posts as of Aug 17
- Wiki is MEGA-synced so it's available on all devices
